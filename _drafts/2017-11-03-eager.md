title: Eager Execution in Tensorflow
tags: techart
---

In the spirit of **Torch**, the **Eager** module supports the imperative model of execution in place of computational graphs. In addition to treating functions as first-class objects, this also requires an alternative way of computing gradients.

Available only with the nightly build (for now).


```python
!pip install tf-nightly
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.contrib.eager as tfe
tfe.enable_eager_execution()
```

```python
a = tf.random_uniform((10,))
b = tf.random_uniform((10,))
print(tf.reduce_sum( (a+b)**2 ))
```
> tf.Tensor(13.9607, shape=(), dtype=float32)
                                                              
```python
def factorial(n):
    f = lambda x: tf.pow(x, n)
    for i in range(n):
        f = tfe.gradients_function(f)
    return f(1.0)
                                                    
print(factorial(5))
```
