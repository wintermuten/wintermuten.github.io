# The End

There's something about a piece of music that's about to end. Everyone I know can recognize it. Thunders of applause echo from the ceaseless clapping of hands that begin the same conspiring moment. As if they speak to the _universality of human experience_. What tells apart the stillness of falling air from a pregnant pause, I do not know.
