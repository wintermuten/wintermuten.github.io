I ran into some old & new references on matrix calculus:
+ [The Matrix Cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf) for basic results on calculating derivatives,
+ [An Extended Collection of Matrix Derivative Results](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/gilesm/files/NA-08-01.pdf) as a substitute,
+ [Matrix Differential Calculus](http://www.janmagnus.nl/misc/mdc2007-3rdedition) which also lists applications and has a section of useful matrix inequalities.
